      <h2 className='ah2'>About Squid Game</h2>
    <ul className='ul1'>
        <li>I created the Squid Game as a reflection of the harsh realities of our society — where the poor struggle to survive while the rich turn suffering into entertainment.</li>
        <li>The idea came from childhood games — simple, innocent, yet full of tension when survival is on the line.</li>
        <li>456 individuals, each burdened by crippling debt and despair, were invited to play for a chance to win 45.6 billion won.</li>
        <li>Every game is inspired by traditional children’s games — twisted into deadly trials where the stakes are life and death.</li>
        <li>The goal? To expose human nature under pressure, desperation, and greed — and to see how far someone would go for a second chance.</li>
    </ul>
     <h2 className='ah2'>Rules of the Game</h2>
    <ul className='ul2'>
        <li>All participants enter voluntarily and agree to the following clauses:
            <ul>
                <li>They must compete in every game.</li>
                <li>Failure to play or losing a game results in immediate elimination (death).</li>
                <li>The game can only end if the majority votes to terminate it.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>There are six games in total — each more intense and psychological than the last.</li>
        <li>Players are stripped of their names and referred to by numbers — identity is irrelevant in this world.</li>
        <li>Guards, Managers, and the Front Man maintain order and prevent cheating. Any breach of rules is punishable by elimination.</li>
        <li>For every eliminated player, 100 million won is added to the prize pool.</li>
        <li>The final winner takes it all — but must live with the consequences of their survival.</li>
        <li>There is no room for compassion. In Squid Game, strategy, trust, and betrayal are your only weapons.</li>
    </ul>
    <h1 className='ah1'>IF ANY PLAYER DIDNT FOLLOW THE RULES HE/SHE WILL BE ELEMINATED...</h1>
